## 🤝 Professional Experience

### eBay Inc. (Data Analyst Intern) | June 2023 – September 2023
● Developed business trend dashboards and pivot table reports using Tableau, PowerPivot, and Excel to visualize the effect of business performance for over 50k listings, directly supporting strategic decision-making in focus categories.
● Built a datacube consisting of over 5 million rows of data for the fashion category to provide multidimensional views, enhancing financial analytics capabilities and resulting in a 30% reduction in decision-making time and a subsequent 10% increase in query efficiency annually.
● Leveraged SQL and Python for developing tables and materialized views to track metrics such as GMV, Bad Buyer Experience, and Live Listings, significantly enhancing the understanding of promotional strategy impacts.
● Managed a cross-departmental project to establish a new data warehousing architecture for more efficient communication between finance and analytics departments, reducing data retrieval time by 25%.

### Hundsun Technologies Inc. (Machine Learning Engineer Intern) | July 2022 – September 2022
● Created an image denoising algorithm that combines both Non-Local Means and Bilateral filter for financial documents dataset, enhancing image quality for better processing accuracy.
● Developed a text detection evaluation system based on DetEval to present object level precision and recall for OCR evaluation.
● Improved PSENet for optical character recognition by integrating a refined NMS algorithm to reduce false positives in text
detection and boosted the accuracy from 69% to 78%.

### Zoom Video Communications (Data Engineer Intern) | January 2021 – April 2021
● Analyzed large-scale IP whitelists using SQL and K-means clustering algorithm to help company avoid DDoS cyber-attack.
● Automated the methods of filtering and tracking the transcoding of recordings in AWS Elastic MapReduce and increased
the accuracy in detecting successful transcoding jobs by 30%.
● Performed anomaly detection analyses on transcoding data using MySQL, Hive, Trino, and Python, identifying rare

## 📖 Research Experience
### UCSB Cheadle Center for Biodiversity and Ecological Restoration (Machine Learning Research Intern) | September 2022– July 2024
● Conducted bee hair quantification research (https://advance.sagepub.com/users/515590/articles/1215597-climate-explains-global-functional-trait-variation-in-bees) using computer vision and submitted the paper to Science and PNAS.
● Designed bee hairiness scores metrics combining image classification ResNet model and image regression model with
Pytorch and achieved RMSE value of 0.31.
● Improved image segmentation on bee hair using UNet with PyTorch on bee images and boosted the accuracy from 76% to 89%.
● Performed texture analysis such as entropy analysis and fractal dimension to establish the evaluation protocol for bee hairiness.
